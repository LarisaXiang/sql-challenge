1. Data Modelling

Check the CSV files to identify relationships among them, and create an ERD using QuickDBD. The key point is to identify the primary key and foreign key for each table.

2. Data Engineering

Utilise the provided information to formulate a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints accordingly.

For the primary keys, validate that the column holds unique values. If not, establish a composite keyLinks to an external site., which requires two primary keys to distinctively identify a row. In this challenge, composite keysLinks are employed in two tables: dept_manager and dept_emp.

Furthermore, sequencing the table creation in the appropriate order is crucial, as it is necessary to manage the foreign keys effectively.

3. Data Analysis

Employ the appropriate syntax to answer each question.
